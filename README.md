# Speed-Read
Cool way to read info extremely fast. Much faster than just reading from a page.
## Principles
The methodology involves the sequential display of words in a designated reading spot, eliminating the need for saccadic eye movements, which are inherent in traditional reading. As each word materializes, the reader's focus remains unswerving, reducing cognitive load and optimizing the reading experience. This approach aligns with principles of perceptual processing and attention management, facilitating superior comprehension and accelerated reading speeds.

## Updates
I would eventually like to create a dictionary of word emphasis value to make individual words be seperate colors for better comprehension.
